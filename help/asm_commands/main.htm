<h1>Historical reference about Blitz3D IDE and Blitz3D SDK</h1>
Let's start with the fact that Blitz3D IDE and Blitz3D SDK are different products.
<br>Blitz3D IDE as is SDK is tools for design 2D and 3D games, demos, 
and interactive applications for Windows operating systems. 
<br>Blitz3D SDK was developed by a team of programmers led by <a href=https://www.marksibly.com target=_main>Mark Sibly</a>.
This SDK was developed as an alternative to the original Blitz3D IDE. 
<br>Unlike original Blitz3D IDE, Blitz3D SDK include a B3D.dll library that contained all the functionality. 
<br>This approach made it possible to write programs in different programming languages like C++, Blitz MAX and other, 
using the Blitz3D API and B3D.dll headers.
<br>At the moment, the sources of the Blitz 3D IDE are in the public domain on github. 
<br>As for the SDK, according to the owls of the Sibly himself, the source codes of the SDK are irretrievably lost. 
<br>However, the SDK itself can still be found on the Internet for download.

<h1>Known Disadvantages of Blitz3D SDK</h1>
<li>Gamma correction is not worked
<li>The volume control function does not work
<br>
<h1>Disadvantages of Blitz3D SDK</h1>
Unlike the original Blitz3D programming language, the SDK lacks the following features:
<br>
<br>
<li>Random generator (Rnd, Rand, SeedRnd, RndSeed)
<li>Time/Date functions (CurrentDate, CurrentTime)
<li>File system functions (OpenFile, ReadFile, WriteFile, CloseFile, Filepos... etc)
<li>Network functions (CountHostsIP, HostIP, DottedIP, CopyStream)
<li>TCP Network functions (OpenTCPStream, CloseTCPStream... etc) 
<li>UDP Network functions (OpenUDPStream, CloseUDPStream... etc)
<br>
<br> 
Also not so important but nevertheless functions present in the originalBlitz3Ð’ language:
<br> 
<br> 
<li>Bank functions (ReadByte, WriteByte, ReadShort, WriteShort.. etc)
<li>File/Stream functions (ReadByte, WriteByte, ReadShort, WriteShort.. etc)
